Q & A Items
David stated he has Invoice questions---he suggested we wait until after the September 25th DLT meeting---set up something early in October to review and discuss with David.  Aurora will focus on District & Building Invoice #1---remind DLT and Building Leaders to continue to focus on commitment to improving instruction and learning outcomes that THEIR building needs at this moment in time and NOT compliance (a path to get $)  :)  Take care of climate/culture so the focus stays on the instruction and learning outcomes and doesn’t become overwhelming.  
",Tracy has numerous dates with Aurora.  See Google Folder for exact dates.  Terri will attend the November 14th DLT meeting.,Expand DLT to include more stakeholder besides Building Admin.

Don’t use information from formative assessments and practice to determine grades; use only summative	evidence. This is tied to CFA and the practice of changing instruction not grades. 15. Don’t leave students out of the grading process. Involve	students; they can - and should - play key roles in assessment and grading that promote 	achievement.

One of the buildings wants to focus on alignment as they have noted their teachers are teaching everything in the book whether it's an expectation or not.  Differentiation is another area they want to pursue.

I talked with them in depth about the VLP and then isolated each of the modules to introduce them briefly.  It was determined that DBDM will probably be the place most of the buildings want to start.  CFA is another area of interest at this time.

We left the meeting with the idea that the administrators would access the VLP at a meeting they will have so they can get in and see what the modules look like.  At that point, they will make contact and we will begin planning the logistics of providing assistance to their district. ",After the DLT has had time to review the VLP and the modules,DLT will meet and review the VLP and modules,Offer assistance,All district buildings.,,,,,,

All building level administrators were present and one assistant administrator.  The purpose of the meeting was to review CWIS data and to discuss challenges getting the VLP on all staff computers.  

On the CWIS, it was noted that only the Middle School had a lower response than anticipated with 11 staff members completing the survey.  A short period of time was provided for them to review their data.  It was noted that the statements regarding the Effective Teaching and Learning Practices had the most areas of concern.  Of particular interest were the following statements:  Learning Targets, Students Assessing their progress, Students Identify next steps, and Students State Success Criteria.  It was noted that in the Middle School, all areas of the Data-Based Decision Making were a concern but it must be pointed out that only 11 had completed the survey from the Middle School, and of those only 2 responded to the questions about DBDM.  Further information is needed before next steps can be planned for this building.  

After review of the data, it was determined that the DLT have additional time to study and review the data before making a decision on next steps.

Newly hired ESSA support was discussed.  It was noted that Kelly O'Laughlin will be joining the team in the future.

Prior to the meeting, steps for assigning the SAPP to all staff members was discussed with the superintendent.  Additional support from Edwin Hall was very helpful.  Their goal is to get everyone access to the web apps and then to VLP during their professional development meeting in the following week.",None scheduled at this time,Get everyone on the VLP,Will contact them to find out if they were successful gaining access to the VLP; will contact Superintendent to determine what assistance we can provide,Black Hawk Elementary; Running Fox Elementary; Middle School; High School; Early Childhood Center; Central Office,,,,,,

Embedded in that will be some initial introduction to the use of formative assessments.  There will be two training groups formed.  One will include the appropriate members of the Early Childhood/Behavioral Center, Black Hawk Elementary, and Running Fox Elementary.  The other will be formed of teachers from the Middle School and High School.  The training will take place on April 27, 2020 from 8:15 to 11:15 in Black Hawk Elementary and at the High School.

Other work was considered and discussed.  At the Early Childhood Center, it was reported that they are trying to rework the Care Team process to meet their needs.  They are also attempting to support curriculum at K-2 and working with Fundations and touch math.  Black Hawk Elementary is focusing on curriculum alignment with teachers currently working independently in ELA.  Running Fox is working to align curriculum in the transitional grades, i.e. 2nd - 3rd to make sure there are no gaps.  They are also focusing on data driven instruction.  The High School is exploring a move to Study Island for the 2020-21 school year.  It was noted that the Middle School does not have Title I services.  They reportedly need a more accessible curriculum and need assistance diversifying instruction, as most of their teachers are content-based and not specifically trained in Middle School teaching.","Only scheduled date is April 27, 2020.","They have other PD planned at this time, including work with dyslexia.",Assistance determining who has access to VLP,All District Buildings,,,,,,

This was an initial observation prior the the planning session for the work to begin next fall.  This district is in the early stages of DCI and have committed to a more concerted effort next year, with DCI being part of the PD planning discussion.

District personnel have had no formal training in DACL, so the expectation of learning targets was not as high as if that training had been completed.  While a few had posted learning targets, most had not.  The district came into the DCI process after having buildings identified as focus buildings.  As a result, PD days had already been planned and most of our interactions with district administrators have involved discussions of DCI and planning.  At this time, the Superintendent has indicated they are actively planning to include DCI in their PD days next school year and they are meetings to determine where to start.

I thought we were going to pick some priority standards or look at IBD reports but they were not available. I think it would be helpful for them to look at their EOC scores and pick a priority standard for each quarter.  Some were using evaluate data. The ass't supt stopped by and he is definitely supportive of this work.  I would like to see a more organized approach.  On the form they filled out there was no mention of a priority standard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They will be given a time for an individual goal each month but that sounds more like an individual PD plan.  I know this is something the district has done but I think they would benefit more by meeting in teams twice a month and doing that individual plan on their own.,There are issues of individual teachers being the only one to teach a subject and I tried to give ideas to the principal of how they could approach that problem.

This building keeps data on several assessments, so by the time for state assessments, they can accurately predict student performance, unless there is some extenuating circumstance in the home, etc.  They make a prediction and then check it against actual student performance on the state assessment. Assessment is triangulated and examined across the school year. Data teams then met to review the final formative results for the academic year. Teachers are always encouraged to bring examples of engaging instructional strategies to share at these meetings. Data teams were looking for growth, not just attainment of a particular score. There were several examples of K-2 students showing growth on this assessment, which was a very positive result. Teachers also discussed ways to build a vertical progression of writing skills and performance.  Staff generally agreed that they need to narrow their focus for the next school year to DACL and coaching. They felt they had tried to do too many different things this year. ",TBD,School is anticipating a site review April 3. ,Will wait for feedback from the site review(from teachers and administrator) and then make plans. ,,,,,,,

For example, I shared that areas not previously marked on Invoices 1 & 2 could still be marked and that a summary was in the folder, also that the Google Slides with links I was using was in the folder. I gave them the link to the folder in the chat. 
     Some are still having difficulties with the VLP and asked me to set up a zoom meeting to address some of them. Kelly has met with some, if not all, of them, and they seemed embarrassed to set up another date with her. I set up a zoom and invited Kelly. Shared that they cannot see team reports until the team has closed it.   
     Shawn (District Contact) said he would send the CWIS link when he received it. He will set a shorter time to take it, most likely within a week. The admin CWIS link was shared. This will tell them the number who have completed for their building. If they have difficulty, the CST can get the information.

The principal has selected two teachers to sit on the team.  One is a fourth grade teacher and the other is an upper level special education teacher.  Because this was the first team meeting, much of the time was spent providing an overview of DCI, reviewing the Implementation Plan completed by the principal at the previous meeting, and discussing the need to get everyone on the VLP.  Time was spent reviewing the CWIS data, which all of the teachers completed, and discussing the evidence found there.  It was noted that the district indicated the use of learning targets was low across the district.  We also went through each module and I provided the graphic that introduced each.  This district uses STAR for Reading and Math assessment at the elementary and discussed the possibility of extending this into the high school.  Time was spent discussing the need to provide students more opportunities to engage with non-fiction, especially in science and social studies.  Determining their priority standards and then aligning them to learning targets is a priority.  They also want to focus this year on differentiation and Data Teams.  Discussion ensued on keeping notes of the meetings where they would be available to all staff members and it was determined they would use Google Classroom.  

The immediate plan is to get everyone access to the VLP by having them register for a DESE web app and then to encourage them to explore the VLP.

SAPP data showed that most teachers rated themselves as a 1 for Essential Function 1 but gave themselves a rating of 4 for Essential Function 3.  The principal questioned these ratings but for now this is the data we are using for planning.  Possible ways to use the DACL module were discussed.  The principal stated she would go through the module on VLP over the holiday break and then make suggestions on how she felt the teachers would best respond to the training.  Walk-throughs were discussed but it was determined those should wait until the training starts and then walk-through to see how teachers are implementing the steps as they are introduced.,"January 6, 2020",DLT will meet on January 6 to determine the next steps for DACL and how that information will be presented to the staff.  ,"At this time, the goal is to be support as they determine how to proceed.

The principal stated she had reviewed the Introduction, reviewing all videos, activities, etc.  She noted that her first thought was that it was a lot for the staff to work with at this time.  She stated just that part took her 1.5 hours and that the teachers would state lack of time -- both personal and professional -- to be able to start this now.  She felt the videos were good and that the information was great, but she noted that the teachers would not know why this was being required of them.

Suggestion was made and accepted to focus this semester on the initial steps that must be in place prior to DACL being instituted.  They will require teachers to use and discuss ""I can"" statements with their students and the consultants will conduct classroom walk-throughs to make a general determination on how that work is progressing.  In addition, the practice profile will be used for feedback reflection and formative assessments will be noted.  In the meantime, the DLT will ensure that teachers are aware as to the plans the district has to incorporate DACL into the 20-21 school year.

The thought is to have different people present DACL to the staff on their PD days beginning next fall and to provide coaching to each teacher as needed.  Because of the walk-throughs focusing on ELA at the elementary level, the DLT was asked to provide schedules to the Consultants.  They were asked to provide those in the next week.

This was a walk through to look for evidence of EF 1 prior to starting the formal training/review of DACL.  Every classroom, except the Special Education resource rooms, were visited from 20 - 30 minutes each.  A large number of rooms had ""I can"" statements posted but the statements were not discussed with students in the majority of cases.  I personally did not hear any referred to during the time I was in the room, but not being in every room at the beginning of class does not allow me to say that no one was introducing those to students.  Kelly indicated that most of her classes also had the statements posted and that in at least one case the students were aware of where the statements were located.

At the previous meeting, the principal shared observations from a review of the DACL overview.  The purpose of this meeting was to make some decisions on how this module would be shared with teachers.  A recent walk-through of the classrooms had shown that, while a majority of the rooms had ""I can"" statements posted, they were not being explained or referred back to during the course of a class period.  The decision was made to begin by focusing on EF1 and to take small steps so teachers are not overwhelmed.  They also want teachers to understand that this is not something new being required, but is just a new way of thinking about talking with students.  The goal of the DLT is to have everyone writing and posting ""I can"" statements by the beginning of the 2020-21 school year.  Transparency with teachers is a critical piece and when they meet with teachers they want to share basic information and goals.  They would also like all teachers to begin collecting examples of strong and weak work that can be used with students during the coming year.

I did the elementary training and Chelsea did the training with the secondary teachers.  I had provided training on the first question (DACL) for the entire district prior to school starting.  We are following backward design with this district.  Their three year goal is DACL.  However, in the planning meeting at the end of last year, it was determined that their teachers or administrators really didn't know what that looked like and sounded like in the classroom.  Since there wasn't much progress in this district last year, the plan was made to help them visualize their goal and then perhaps they would see the need for some foundational work to be done.  This has certainly proved to be true.  The instructional coaches are systematically working through the CFA work with all grade levels and courses in the district throughout this year. It is a collaborative process.  CSTs are providing coaching support for the coaches as needed.  The Director of Instruction sent me a copy of their schedule with this work for the year.  It represents a consistent, systematic plan.  I am getting positive feedback.  The high school principal told me that one of his most respected math teachers told him that this is the first time that he can remember when he felt like the work the teams were doing was going to make a difference.

High School: The high school principal has already began implementing a process for deepening the DBDM process with his teachers.  He used data from the SAPP to provide the focus. They are using the practice profile rubric to monitor their progress. We shared the VLP with the principal and suggested his teachers use this as deemed necessary. This work is leading the teachers to question the rigor of their assessments (considered a good thing).  The tentative plan is to check back with the principal in a few weeks and most likely provide some training with the CFA module second semester.  We are looking at dates for this work.  

Middle School: The middle school is focusing on collaborative teams.  They have considerable work to do in this area, but most of the intensity of the work will most likely be in the first essential function.  The leadership team (with the guidance of the principal) have already been working on a schedule and structure of the collaborative meetings.  We explained the VLP to the principal.  The plan is for the leadership team to decide exactly how the VLP might be most effectively used during their next PD day.  They will use the practice profile rubric to monitor their progress.  We will be checking in with the principal in the next couple of weeks for an update.

Elementary:  This principal is already hard at work with her teachers to strengthen collaborative teams and the DBDM process.  They have determined some weak links in their curriculum in the area of reading that they are addressing heading-on.  The instructional coach is playing a major part in this work.  We explained the VLP to the principal, but at this time suggested that they continue what they are doing while using the practice profile to monitor their work.  We will be staying in touch.  
","Future dates have not been determined at this time.  However,  we are in the process of looking at dates with each building.",Continue the work as planned,Continue to stay in touch and support as needed,,,,,,,

All teams followed the agreed upon protocol for the meeting.  The principal recorded detailed notes on each student discussed and teachers will enter update information on the individual data collection sheet that serves as a running record from one grade level to the next.  The principal asked for feedback during a break. We were able to share several positives about the meeting: respectful, timely, followed agenda and protocol, the principal and all interventionists involvement on a regular basis, on-going records.

We discussed the necessity for teachers and leaders to use the SAPP  and CWIS data to guide their planning process.

The agenda for this meeting included two major topics.  The first was the data that placed them in Targeted status.  The focus was on how the data was generated and what steps must be taken to correct the current status.  It was noted that the data comes from the MPI and that a total of 125 IEP students were included in the data with 15 of those students scoring at Below Basic.  Discussion ensued on steps to take.  The first semester, the Middle and High School teachers focused on steps they could take in all classrooms to improve ELA scores for the 19-20 assessment.  It was noted that math has already met the improvement goal for the first year and that they must maintain or improve in that area as well as improve in ELA.  

The Superintendent spoke about their current CSIP, which was the second major topic discussed,  and stated they were in the process of researching and developing a new plan which would take effect in June 2020. 

Teams worked together for the rest of the meeting to determine the outcome of Effective Teaching Practices with which they were working and to develop next steps for the building.","February 12, 2020",Continue work with Effective Teaching Practices and use district chosen assessment to track progress and determine which students need extra support. ,Support the work of the district,Highland High School and Middle School ,,,,,,

We discussed meeting in late May to plan for the 2021-22 school year as it relates to DCI.  The thought was to begin serious work on DACL, plan those dates, and then schedule walk-throughs and feedback opportunities.

I asked about Data Teams this year and she stated they hadn't done any because there was no data to team around.  As a result, I asked if they are giving formative assessments of any kind and she stated ""not a lot"".  It is my feeling that focusing on DACL will open the door to further discussions around CFAs and the necessity for providing teachers and students information for goal-setting through the use of formative assessments.

I contacted Tammy to see if we could make that available to them.

We also looked at the SAPP data.  It was decided that next steps would focus on the low areas of the DBDM process.  While the elementary teachers have been active with the DBDM some of the secondary teachers may not have had as much experience.

The data, once located, gave her a better picture of the next steps Newtown-Harris needs to take.  

I visited every classroom in the building, from Pre-K to their high school offerings, and observed a variety of strategies being utilized in the various classrooms.

We worked on trying to come up with next steps but were not able to clearing define what that should be. Asst. Principal kept referring back to CPP(Consume, Process, and Produce). Wanted to make sure that our process would fit this because the HS staff were all doing this. One of the teachers did not feel this was happening like the  AP did but we did acknowledge his point. 

They had concerns about too many initiatives happening at one time and looking for how this might fit with them. Felt like some teachers might  be unwilling to buy in since they have been told many things with no follow through in the past and would not want to invest in one more thing like that. 

They do not seem eager to begin something else. The social studies teacher did however really liked what he was hearing and would like to find a way to get it to work for them. The Principal keeps wanting proof that of this working in other similar districts. I am feeling like he thinks it is a good process but may have some concerns that it would be the right fit for him and his staff at this point. Even thought we talk about this be researched based process, he was still having a challenge getting to the point that it could work for him.

R-VI,Myra Collins,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an introductory meeting with the Superintendent, James Simmelink.  We discussed the make-up of the district, the number of teachers in each building and at each level, some of the challenges of a small district, and their transition from PLC to DCI.  We looked at the Practice Profiles as a general discussion of their intent and purpose.  Mr. Simmelink was not willing to go beyond that discussion without having the team available.  We discussed the team they currently have in place and then determined a date for the DLT meeting.  He shared their goals for the coming year:  Goal 1 is work with Collaborative Teams and Goal 2 is a focus on CFAs.  He noted that they need a solid curriculum, which is not in place in some areas.  

He noted that many of their teachers had gone through a Data Team training several years ago but stated most of those teachers are no longer with the district.  We briefly discussed the possibility of using the VPN to get the teachers trained in this area but no decisions were made.

R-VI,"Myra Collins, Patty Wilmes",Yes,Yes,,,,Yes,,,,,Yes,"According to their SAPP, they are in pretty good shape and their CWIS echoed that information.  It was noted that they need to work on the group processes and we were told they were aware they needed to have agendas, take minutes and save those so they are accessible.  After taking the SAPP last spring they began implementing procedures to correct this.  As a former PLC, much of this was already in place.

They had previously set two goals for the 2019-20 year.  Goal 1 was on the development of their Collaborative Teams.  Specifically they want to (1) Develop process for effective and focused collaborative team meetings; (2) Develop common purpose and goals for collaborative teams; and (3) Effectively utilize the team processes.",Yes,"This is a goal for this district this year.  They plan to begin with identifying priority standards, unwrapping standards and then writing learning targets.  Hopefully some of this work will begin in the second semester as the other work is completed.

This area was incorporated in their Goal 2.  They want to (1) develop clear and meaningful learning targets to guide instruction and student learning; (2) Create success criteria for learning targets; and (3) Construct quality assessment instruments which are of sound design and measure pre-determined learning targets.",Yes,Because the elementary has more than one teacher at a grade level they have made more use of the DBDM process.  Time was spent discussing how this might work at the MS/HS where most of the teachers are singletons in their content area.  The change in State assessments has created a need for more focused attention on writing in the content areas.  This was discussed as a possible area for DBDM at the MS/HS as well as through the district.  No final decisions were made on this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,their Professional Learning Plan for the district,"I've already shared much of what was discussed.  However, it is to be noted that the district is going to work as a district and not as two separate buildings.  As a result, all district staff will be trained on identifying priority standards and will begin that process during the PD day in October.  Many of the instructors at the MS/HS have curriculum maps but have not done the work of alignment, so it was felt this was a critical first step by the district.  Some of the elementary teachers already have identified some priority standards but will be reviewing and editing since the original work was done with the Common Core and just tweaked with the adoption of MLS.  At the elementary, they have determined their work will begin in the area of math. The MS/HS teachers will focus on their content areas.  

The MS/HS is going to work with developing and strengthening their Collaborative teams but the principal wants to do that work on their own.  It was suggested that he go into the VLP and look at that module and then assign it, or parts of it, to his teachers to view.  It was noted that they can do this independently or in small groups but specific details were left until he decides how to utilize the resource.","October 14,  2019",begin identifying priority standards and unwrapping in preparation for writing learning targets,We will be checking on the progress at the MS/HS as they work to improve their Collaborative Teams.

The high school teachers focused on their content areas.  Elementary teachers focused in the area of mathematics.  The elementary adopted a new text series for grades 3 to 6 and are still in the process of aligning that, although that is not where we were working at this workshop.  The K-2 teachers have a program they selected from Teachers Pay Teachers and are considering a move to a series similar to the upper elementary.  There was a lot of good discussion around what were considered the most important standards that all students should know and understand.  

It was indicated the DLT would meet to determine next steps and then we will plan how we might support their work.",November 11 is the next scheduled PD,Unknown at this time.

Those goals included the Development of Collaborative Teams, especially at the Middle School/High School, the preparation and use of CFAs, and the use of Data-based Decision Making, again focused on the Middle School/High School.
The DLT also had an opportunity to review and consider the CWIS in the new format that is available.  Some discussion followed.  A data review indicated:  
Elementary:  A low area was in reviewing CFA with teacher.  While the state average is also low, this is an area they would like to improve.
Leadership:  This was high in every category.  
Middle School and High School:  These buildings were lower than the elementary in all areas, due, in part, to the opportunity the elementary teachers had to have some of this training in the past.  The upper grades have no background in CFA or data teams and need that training.
Low areas on the CWIS included CFA and Data Teams.  It was discussed that in a small school, one or two votes in an area has much more impact than in a large school.  It was noted that teachers were not always sure what an indicator meant.
One of the areas which was mentioned as a concern was the tendency to collect data, but not to formally discuss and then use it.  An important area is determining what new steps to take when students aren’t successful, but that is not being discussed and then utilized as the DLT would like.
This spring, the CWIS will be taken as a district-wide group, with the various indicators being briefly introduced by the administration.  From there, the next steps in the process will be discussed.
It was proposed that next fall, two days be set aside for professional development which would focus on the DCI process.  By using two days, teachers could be given a solid foundation from which to begin building.  
For now, teachers at the middle school and high school will be given a one-half day introduction to Collaborative Teams and the process which has been found to be most effective.  This will be presented at the February 24 PD day beginning at 1:00.  On March 30, the entire faculty will gather to take the CWIS as described above.  
In the meantime, the instructional methods used at the middle school will be explored and suggestions offered for ways to improve or change that instruction.  The elementary plans to explore and eventually select a new math curriculum for next.

The district is hoping to make a year-long plan for 20-21, but since the elementary has already had Collaborative Team training through PLC, I was asked to assist them at the upper grades.  This was quite simply an introduction.  As an addition, I provided the materials for them to work as teams (there are two identified teams in the MS/HS) to build a spaghetti tower.  I discovered that the teachers in this district are quite competitive.  Not only did they want to build the tower -- they wanted me to measure to see which tower was the tallest!  When we completed the activity, we discussed Pluses/Positives that they had discovered as they worked for the first time in their new teams.  We continued our reflections by discussing the Minus/Negative aspects of their teamwork.  Time was a big concern, as each team have seven or eight members who do not have similar planning times.  Finding a common topic was also discussed, with the idea of writing being something every class did being offered as a starting point.  Finally, we talked about things they might want to change, consider, etc. before beginning their serious teamwork next fall.  It was a great discussion.

We were able to point out that this helps the teachers know how to restructure their teaching to assist students to be most successful.  The CFA provides the teacher with time to reteach as needed prior to the summative assessment.  Because the next meeting is in February or March, the teachers were encouraged to submit their completed CFAs to Bruce and Myra for review and comment with the goal of giving one of them, if possible, prior to our next meeting.","February or March, 2021.

Feedback was offered through Google forms after Bruce and I had reviewed it.  Each teacher is to submit two CFAs for review and then use in the second semester.   Once taken by students, we will data team around the CFAs to determine how effective the CFAs were.   Teachers were encouraged to consider the rigor of the standard and to write items that at the very least come close to that level of rigor.  It is noted that the teachers actively included the vocabulary they had identified as necessary for understanding the teaching in their assessments which will allow them to locate misconceptions earlier in the unit.  While the next date is not determined at this time, it was suggested it would not be until February or March.  It was suggested that Bruce and I could come and meet with teachers on their planning times in an effort to give immediate feedback and to keep the process moving forward.

Most of those, according to the teachers, were taken from Evaluate, which is a benchmark type test given monthly by the district.  Suggestions for increasing the rigor were made.  In addition, short answer questions or open-ended statements were encouraged as a way to better determine what students know and/or understand, and as a method of determining where misconceptions may occur that need to be corrected.

Suggestions were made to not check students on all three solution strategies, but to focus on one at a time so the teacher could determine where misconceptions lie.  A variety of questions were suggested which could  be used to determine student understanding as opposed to just ""finding an answer"".

The fact that teachers were already able to create these assessments will make create summative assessments for SBG much easier and more efficient than if they had not had such a great background with MMD.,Yes,The whole premise of SBG is making decisions based on data alone.  This can be such a challenge for teachers who are not accustomed to tracking data.  The MMD background with DBDM will really help make this process smoother.,Yes,"SBG requires teachers to really concentrate on what is essential to the grade level and district standards , thereby eliminating ""fluff.""  In order to provide effective reteaching and enrichment, while still moving forward with the new material requires skillful teaching and teamwork.  Effective teaching and learning practices will have to be a constant discussion and focus in collaborative teams and throughout all district PD.  This was a real concern among the teachers in my sessions.  It is very overwhelming to think of keeping all of these balls in the air without a lot of support!",,,,,,,Yes,I made a concentrated effort to show the tie between what they had done through MMD and how that had really built a strong foundation for what they wanted to do with SBG.  It is a very natural progression.,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,"When I was first asked to come and speak about SBG, I was told I would be with intermediate elementary teachers.  This was ideal, as my background in SBG is only with elementary.  However, they ended up placing me with high school teachers due to scheduling conflicts.  It was okay, as my ""presentation"" was really only about how MMD had given the district a great foundation and jumping off point for the transition into SBG.  I then moved into some mindset shifts that would need to happen among all staff members for the transition to standards-based to be effective.  I will say that the MMD foundational piece of the session went very well.  All teachers and admin present seemed very well-versed in CT, CFAs, DBDM, and DACLs.  They all agreed that they were in a good place to make changes.  I had a really good feeling about that.  The shifts in mindset were a little harder for some of the classroom teachers, and I think part of the issue was that they really wanted to hear from a person who had a background with secondary levels.  They didn't so much want to wax philosophically as they wanted to know exactly how it would look and work.  The administrators who were present asked many good questions and seemed open to the idea of taking it slowly and working on building-up the teachers' background and understanding before pushing them to make changes.  I am hopeful that they will do that.  The move toward SBG is not an easy one, and teachers need to really believe in it and support it to make it work.","None on the books, but the elementary and secondary principals did mention having me come back to do building-specific PD.","K-4 has some subjects that are graded standards-based now, with the plan to slowly increase.  I was told that the goal is to move K-12 to SBG within 4-5 years. As I am not part of their cadre, I am unsure of what their MMD goals are, but they could easily align with this.","I have no suggestions at this time.

The only Pierce City participants in the Zoom were Emily Scott, new elementary principal and Jennifer Graves, their contact person.  So, we were able to have a very candid conversation with them about their scores.  Their scores do not reflect a deep level of implementation, even in the foundational areas.  In fact, in many, many areas they are below the state average.

As you know, Jennifer is a rock, but she is leaving their district.  I recommended that she share this data with the superintendent, Dr. Kelli Alumbaugh, and point out the details in the CWIS data.  For example, they have teachers stating that they don't use state standards to align their assessment tools.  Some of their answers are alarming for reasons beyond the scope of our work.  She is planning to share this information with all of the administrators so that it will be used in planning for next year.

Considering that they are grossly below where I had hoped they would be, I would like to recommend that they stay in the Early Implementation Zone.  They will need to review those foundational modules again next year, and their CST will need to conduct walk-throughs and fidelity checks with their administrators. (We discussed all of this with Jennifer and Emily.)  I also think they need to be worked with in smaller groups than we were able to do this year.  We often presented to the entire faculty, and it obviously didn't reach them as we had hoped.  I explained to them that they might have to do rotating subs or do PD by building, and Shanna mentioned bringing their own data so that it can be analyzed - and they will see the power of the DCI model.
",,They need to work on building a growth mindset with their staff so they are open to doing this work.  There are some culture pieces that are preventing them from moving forward.,Set dates for training - but it needs to be in small chunks with smaller groups of teachers.,Elementary Principal and Contact Person,,,,,,

My role was to support, offer suggestions, clarify meaning, and model activities as needed.  As we went through the day, struggles were identified and clarified.  Each activity in the module was done in full, but we discussed at length how to run it with the entire faculty present.  (Only 5 BLT were identified from each building.)  In the second round, I modeled how to do a Snowball activity with the human bar graph and we discussed how best to share the data.  By the third round, many of the challenges had been ironed out.  Discussion led to the conclusion that teachers would be assigned a table in an effort to mix the grade levels.  They felt this would lead to better discussion as each building has unique issues and concerns.  Before each group finished, the expectation that the group would be responsible for one of the other modules was discussed and modules were chosen.

All of the other grade levels in the building have completed this work in math, ELA, and have the social studies/ELA crosswalk from the state.  Science is the only content area they are lacking. Plans are being made to do the science with the elementary teachers.  The teachers are anxious to build units of instruction using the rigorous priority standards they have selected. They have proficiency scales created for Level 3 and 4 for each priority standard that gives an example of the success criteria for each level.  The intention of this district is to move to standards-based report cards.  
This building of teachers has been remarkable to work with.  They are eager to learn.  Considering that we started at the beginning of this year with DACL, the teachers see the value in the work of collaborative teams, CFAs.  They also understand that they will use DBDM with their formative assessments next year to help them determine how their students are progressing toward a standard rather than only relying on a benchmark assessment, such as STAR.

There was definitely lots of positive feedback; however, the core of DACL was not seen on a regular basis.  Most of the time today was spent on working together to seek to understand what their strengths were and where the gaps were.  One thing that was determined was that the teachers had a lot on their plates this year including a new ELA program that was very intensive and it's implementation very different than the way they were used to teaching. It was also suggested that even though they had DACL training last year, they really hadn't made implementation a priority.  One principal was out of town for this PD, so we left several options on the table.Those we discussed is as follows: 
1.) Perhaps they need to spend some time working on the learning progressions for each priority for each grade level which would allow the teachers to understand where they are going and the steps to getting there. (This would include some CFA work.) Then, they could share this information with the students so that they could determine their level of learning. 
2.) If or once the learning progressions are in order, I could train on each DACL quesion seperately.  Then, allow time for them to implement in their classrooms and use peer coaching to increase success. I would continue to train on the last two questions following the same process.
3.) Maybe a combination of 1 and 2.

I was so impressed with their desire to want real data and to want to implement DACL with fidelity, even if that meant going back and closing a gap that they hadn't realized until now.  I shared with this staff that this way of thinking is truely what an Assessment Capable District would do.  It is a priviledge to work with this district.

Each portion ended by doing a summary of key points, questions, and learning. The overarching goal was to share experiences and give feedback about implementation of the practices.  Teachers sat at tables in grade bands K-2, 3-5, and 6-8. Discussions were focused, lively, and productive.

Several teachers cited the need to be more aware of saving anchor charts, having students do more charting of their performance and goal setting, and being proactive about essential questions that help drive daily learning targets. They also decided that the items on which they had concerns would be the perfect look-fors during their peer coaching opportunities.

Robyn wants to help her staff to see the connection of what the district is doing and how it connects to what they are doing in her building.  We worked on a plan for one of her back to school days.  She has chosen a ""puzzle piece"" theme to help with how things fit together.  She has great ideas in place as far as an icebreaker and teambuilder that will be used for reflection.  She will start with looking at the MMD big picture with the district focus.  This will include visiting the district mission and vision and teacher standards 1.2 and 5.2.  Next they will  look at the building mission and vision, DACL, and SBIC.  Dara, the lead teacher who was trained in SBIC, will share some highlights she has learned and implemented.  Next, they will look at the DACL Practice Profile and compare their building's vocabulary to the vocabulary used in the practice profile so everyone has a clear picture.  They will take the SAPP (possibly a paper copy) with jotting down their evidence as to why they are in a certain area.  Next they will do a ""Notice and Wonder"" to look at the district's ""Teacher Goal Growth Guide"" and the DACL Practice Profile.  Their last step will be to work on their goal for the district (Teacher Goal Growth Goal Guide), using the DACL practice profile.  They write a SMART goal on this guide.  The SAPP will be used for the data to show growth. 
 Their reflection will come through a teambuilder that they will end their day with.",September 23,,"To send resources such as the DACL walk through (done), to make sure Robyn can get into VLP.",,,,,,,

He asked if there could be a way to identify if the session is from/for different level of buildings. Jeremy now feels they are further along than he originally throught. 

Jeremy had a few concerns about whether there was true district alignment and why the same person wasn't working with all of the buildings. ClauDean and I explained that calendars (their's and our's) don't allow for this to happen. He asked how we ensure we are giving the same information to the buildings.

As this was taken before school started, several felt the new teachers would have had no idea and no experience with some of the statements.

Regarding data teams, it was suggested that during the data team process, teachers could share strategies and discuss what is or is not working with their students.  The suggestion was met with lack of enthusiasm as teachers did not appear to comprehend how this could work across content areas.  It must be noted that to my knowledge the Middle school and High School have not had actual training in data teaming, while the elementary did have the training as part of their CW work and had been using the Data Team process in monthly meeting the last three or four years.

The curriculum facilitator shared ideas for demonstrating to students ""where they are"" in their learning across a unit by using a series of graphics that demonstrated the main concepts in the unit. A matching folder in which they could document their own growth was also shared. Younger students could use the graphics as demonstrated posted vertically and place a marker next to the picture that describes where they are and what the next step is.
